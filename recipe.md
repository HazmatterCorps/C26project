1. grab a tomato. I have a garden so i pick it fresh.
2. inspect it to make sure theres no bugs or rot.
3. wash it thoroughly to wash of anything you cant see.
4. But it in a grinding machine. grind its juice out and untill you have the pulp and juice. Repeat until theres no more juice to extract
5. grab the spices of your choice.
6. pour the juice into a jar.
7. add the spices into the jar of tomato juice and let it set as long as you like to absorb the flavor into it.
8. when done pour it into a bowl and some butter. make sure the butter not chunky. chunky soup...is disgusting to say the least.
9. warm soup and bon appeite.
